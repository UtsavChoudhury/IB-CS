## 📋 Coding Standards

### Python Code Style
- Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) guidelines
- Use meaningful variable names
- Include docstrings for functions
- Add inline comments for complex logic
- Keep functions focused and concise

### Example Format
```python
"""
Topic: [Brief description]
IB Computer Science - Term X, Section Y
Author: [Your name]
Date: [YYYY-MM-DD]
"""

def calculate_average(numbers):
    """
    Calculate the average of a list of numbers.
    
    Args:
        numbers (list): List of numeric values
        
    Returns:
        float: The average of the input numbers
        
    Example:
        >>> calculate_average([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
        3.0
    """
    if not numbers:
        return 0
    
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)  # Calculate mean


# Example usage with clear output
if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_data = [85, 92, 78, 96, 88]
    result = calculate_average(test_data)
    print(f"Average grade: {result:.1f}%")
```

### File Organization
- Place files in appropriate Term/Topic directories
- Use descriptive filenames (`bubble_sort_example.py`, not `sort.py`)
- Include both basic and advanced examples when possible
- Separate theory materials from practical code

### Documentation Guidelines
- Write clear, educational explanations
- Include IB-relevant context
- Explain the "why" not just the "how"
- Use proper Markdown formatting
- Add links to relevant IB resources when applicable

## 📋 Commit Message Format

Use emojis and clear descriptions:
- `🚀 Add:` New features or examples
- `🐛 Fix:` Bug fixes
- `📝 Docs:` Documentation updates
- `✨ Improve:` Code improvements
- `🧼 Clean:` Code cleanup
- `🎨 Style:` Formatting changes

Example: `🚀 Add: Binary search implementation with step-by-step comments`
